    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The recipe for Grilled Cheese Sandwich from Allrecipes is a classic and straightforward dish that results in a
        deliciously crispy and gooey sandwich. To make this iconic comfort food, you start by spreading butter on the
        outside of the bread slices and layering slices of your preferred cheese in between. The sandwich is then cooked
        on a griddle or in a skillet until the bread turns golden brown and the cheese melts to perfection. The result
        is a satisfying and timeless grilled cheese sandwich that pairs well with a bowl of tomato soup or simply on its
        own for a quick and satisfying meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread
            butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and
            place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with
            remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
    </ol>

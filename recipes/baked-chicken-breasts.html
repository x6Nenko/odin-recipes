    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
